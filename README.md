# Online Food Order Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes an online food order dataset to understand customer behavior and preferences. The analysis includes visualizations of key factors influencing food ordering decisions such as age, family size, and feedback.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about customers who ordered food online, including:
- Demographic data (Age, Gender, Marital Status)
- Occupation and Income levels
- Educational Qualifications
- Family size
- Geographic data (latitude, longitude, pin code)
- Order decisions (Output: Yes/No)
- Customer feedback

## Key Findings
1. **Age Distribution**: Younger customers (20-30 years) are more likely to order food online.
2. **Family Size Impact**: Smaller families (1-4 members) tend to order more frequently than larger families.
3. **Positive Feedback**: Most customers who ordered again left positive feedback.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly Express

## Code Structure
The analysis is contained in a Jupyter Notebook (`online_food_order.ipynb`) with the following sections:
1. Data loading and initial exploration
2. Data visualization:
   - Age distribution analysis
   - Family size impact analysis
   - Feedback analysis
3. Data filtering for repeat customers

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly`
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook

## Future Work
- Add machine learning models to predict order likelihood
- Include more detailed geographic analysis
- Analyze time-based ordering patterns
